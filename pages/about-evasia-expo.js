            <div className="subtitle mb-3">EV Market in India </div>
            <p>
              The Indian automobile industry ranked fifth largest globally and
              is expected to become the third largest by 2030 as the demand for
              EV is growing tremendously due to population rise. So dependence
              on conventional energy resources is not suitable as India imports
              nearly 80% of its crude oil requirements. Moreover, NITI Aayog
              aims to achieve 70% penetration of EVs in all types by 2030,
              intending to attain net zero carbon emissions by 2070. According
              to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, around 0.6 million EVs were
              registered in India in the last three years.
            </p>
            <p>
              There have been several reputed studies (NITI Aayog, CEEW-CEF,
              RBSA Advisors, KPMG, etc.) conducted internationally on the EV
              industry scenario and here are some of the projections to meet
              India&rsquo;s EV ambition:
