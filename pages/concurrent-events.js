              Join us on India&apos;s exciting solar journey in the next five years
            </div>
            <p>
              Analysts and industry leaders will share their assessments on
              roof-top and large scale applications like Floating Solar, Agro PV
              and Grid Scale Storage. Energy storage is becoming a crucial
              element in the fast growing RE business and the emerging EV
              business in India. With growing integration of RE into the grid,
              managing the instability becomes a challenge and energy storage
              systems are preferred to stabilize the grid. Stay ahead of the
              competition and make sure you are on track with India&apos;s energy and
              mobility transformation.

              aspirations of India&apos;s solar, energy storage and e-mobility
              stakeholders. The three-day conference is structured such that key
              stakeholders from the business and end user sectors get critical
              inputs, and get connected to relevant experts.
